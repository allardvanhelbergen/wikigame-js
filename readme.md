# Wikigame.js

This is the software used for the [Six degrees of Wikipedia](http://www.re-publica.de/sessions/six-degrees-wikipedia) Game at [re:publica](http://www.re-publica.de/). 

It's neither well written nor documented, but so many people asked me to release it that i could not refuse. 
It was written in just a couple of hours.
